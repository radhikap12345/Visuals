			Hello! I am Radhika.<br>
			I am a PhD student in Stanford’s mechanical engineering department since Fall 2016. I am a graduate from 
			Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in Computer Science. 
			My PhD research focuses on experimental characterization of mechanical properties of nanomaterials. 
			It involves synthesizing nanoparticles, thin films and nanostructures to study their strengths, 
			deformation mechanisms and other relevant mechanical properties.
			</p>
			<p class='text-left'>
			I am an ardent patron of design thinking and innovation. 
			Since an early age I liked the idea of making small modifications to things to make them more comfortable and useful. 
			This was one of the reasons I chose mechanical engineering, believing Products are an imperative part of the subject. 
			Building up on my interest I have explored Product design, innovation, entrepreneurship and product management in my 
			undergrad and grad life. However I think that design thinking is not limited to just products and markets but could 
			be used anywhere including research. I also think that good products in today’ s world can be designed only if we can 
			leverage all possible exciting technologies at our disposal, especially in computers. 
			To design better solutions, I must understand what can be possible, and for this reason, 
			I have continued to get acquainted with the trending CS topics of machine learning, data mining, nlp, deep learning etc.
			</p>
			
			<p class='text-left'>
			I’m a strong believer of expanding horizons on all aspects of life. 
			I love to acquire and improve on new skills and activities, it’s my definition of progress and a source of adventure. 
			Whether its academic like learning a new software, or nonacademic, like getting a feel of a new language (spoken), 
			I have never felt limited to perceptions of what I ‘should ‘ be studying and rather am always on lookout for new 
			things that can add value to my life. For this reason I’m fond of a lot of extra-curricular activities, not expert in any, 
			but a flavor of many. Being a very audio-visual person, I love to paint and play with colors and hum and sway to guitar 
			and keyboard. Over time I have turned into a health freak paying close attention to running, swimming gymming and healthy 
			eating habits. And last but not the least, I love social dancing, something I am very proud I picked up at Stanford. 
			Waltz, polka and swing are some of my favorites.
			</p>
			
			<p class='text-left'>
			With this I will conclude my introduction. <br>
			Thank you for taking the time to read and know me. 
			I would be more than happy to get in touch, converse, discuss and learn about anything .
			</p>
			<p class='text-left'>
			And a link to my structured resume in pdf format is attached <a href="#">here</a>
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p class='text-right'>
			Sincerely,<br>
			Radhika
